This repository contains the backend implementation of a Todo List application built using MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and tested with Postman API.

It provides APIs to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on todo items.
By integrating MongoDB as the database and Express.js for handling HTTP requests, this backend offers a robust foundation for building scalable todo list applications.


Features
CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on todo items.
MongoDB Integration: Utilizes MongoDB for data storage, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
Express.js: Built on Express.js, providing a robust and efficient server framework.
Node.js: Powered by Node.js, allowing for asynchronous and event-driven backend operations.
Postman API Testing: APIs can be tested and validated using Postman, ensuring reliability and consistency.
